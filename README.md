# Data Analysis Project : Consumer-Segmentation-based-on-Spending-Patterns


# 🧮 Data Analysis - Consumer Segmentation Based on Spending Patterns

This project performs **exploratory data analysis and segmentation** of consumers based on their spending behavior. Using Python libraries like **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis helps to uncover hidden patterns in consumer data which can assist businesses in **targeted marketing strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze customer spending patterns and segment consumers into distinct groups based on their:
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Age
- Occupation
- Gender

These insights can help companies create **personalized offers** and improve **customer satisfaction and retention**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a synthetic **Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**, typically consisting of:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1–100)`

📚 Insights & Outcomes

- High-spending customers are typically younger with mid-level income.

- Female customers have slightly higher average spending scores.

- Age and Spending Score show moderate correlation—youth tend to spend more.

- Potential to apply clustering (e.g., KMeans) in future enhancement.
